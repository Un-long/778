  What is a constructor in Python?
>     A constructor in Python is a special type of method (function) that is used to initialize members of an instance of a class.
>     
>     In C++ or Java, the constructor has the same name as its class, in Python the constructor is handled differently. It is used to create an
> object.
>     
>     There are two types of constructors:
>     
>     Parameterized constructor
>     Nonparametric constructor
>     The constructor definition is executed when we create an object of this class. The constructors also check that the object has enough
> resources to perform any startup task.
>     
>     Creating a Python constructor
>     In Python, the __init__() method simulates a class constructor. This method is called when creating an instance of the class. It takes
> the keyword self as the first argument, which allows access to the
> attributes or method of the class.
>     
>     We can pass any number of arguments during the creation of the class object, depending on the definition of __init __(). It is mainly
> used for.

    class Employee:
    
    def __init__(self, name, id): 
        self.id = id 
        self.name = name 

 

    def display(self): 
        print("ID: %d nName: %s" % (self.id, self.name)) 

 
 

    emp1 = Employee("John", 101) 
    emp2 = Employee("David", 102) 

 
# accessing display() method to print employee 1 information 
 

    emp1.display() 

 
# accessing display() method to print employee 2 information 
emp2.display()

    class Student:   
        count = 0   
        def __init__(self):

    s2=Student()   
    s3=Student()   
    print("The number of students:",Student.count)

    class Student: 
        # Constructor - non parameterized 
        def __init__(self):
